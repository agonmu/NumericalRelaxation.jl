This package is an outcome of the research of the [Chair of Mechanics - Continuum Mechanics Ruhr-University Bochum](http://www.lkm.rub.de/index.html.en) in collaboration with [Chair of Computational Mathematics - University of Augsburg](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/en/fakultaet/mntf/math/prof/numa/)

The goal of this project is the (semi-)convexification of some energy function $W$, which often becomes non-convex in dissipative continuum mechanics.
