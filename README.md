# NumericalRelaxation.jl

This package implements various convexification algorithms that can be used for the numerical relaxation of variational problems.

Install the package with

```
pkg> add https://github.com/koehlerson/NumericalRelaxation.jl
```

The implemented methods are research results from the following papers:

1. [Adaptive convexification of microsphere-based incremental damage for stress and strain softening at finite strains](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00707-022-03332-1)
2. [Multidimensional rank-one convexification of incremental damage models at finite strains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14318)

If you use one-dimensional convexification procedures, please cite the prior.
In case you want to use rank-one convexification refer to the second paper.
