# NumericalRelaxation.jl

This package implements various convexification algorithms that can be used for the numerical relaxation of variational problems.

Install the package with

```
pkg> add https://github.com/koehlerson/NumericalRelaxation.jl
```

**This package is currently not functional, since it was part of another package. Soon, there will be a 1.0 release.**
